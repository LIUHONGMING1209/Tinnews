# Tinnews: a Android-based Tinder-like News App
1. Designed the Tinder-like News app based on MVP architectural pattern
2. Added ViewPager with BottomBar that holds News/Save/Setting Tabs’ state in the MainActivity concurrently
3. Implemented swipe gestures for liking/disliking the news with Mindorks’s PlaceHolderView 
4. Utilized Retrofit and Rxjava to pull the latest news data (category, editor, etc.) from a RESTFUL endpoint (newsapi.org)
